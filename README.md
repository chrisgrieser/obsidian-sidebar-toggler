Finer control of the Obsidian sidebars. To be used with an external window manager.

## What the plugin does
It adds four commands for toggling the sidebar. As opposed to Obsidian's native commands, which only allow *toggling* of the sidebars, you can explicitly determine whether to show or hide them.
- Hide left sidebar
- Hide right sidebar
- Show left sidebar
- Show right sidebar

In addition, the plugin registers four URI schemes for those commands:

```text
obsidian://sidebar?side=left&show=false
obsidian://sidebar?side=right&show=false
obsidian://sidebar?side=left&show=true
obsidian://sidebar?side=right&show=true
```

## Purpose of this plugin
The main use for this plugin is to provide a simple and clear method for __window management apps__ to control Obsidian's sidebars. Just add something like `open "obsidian://sidebar?side=left&show=false"` to your window management configuration to have your window manager control Obsidian's sidebars.

I, for example, have configured to hide Obsidian's sidebars when I trigger a vertical split of my windows. When I maximize my Obsidian window, the sidebars are shown again.

For the macOS Automation app [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/), for example, such a function could look like this:

```lua
function toggleObsidianSidebar (obsiWin)
  local obsi_width = obsiWin:frame().w
  local screen_width = obsiWin:screen():frame().w
  if (obsi_width / screen_width > 0.6) then
  	hs.urlevent.openURL("obsidian://sidebar?side=left&show=true")
  else
  	hs.urlevent.openURL("obsidian://sidebar?side=left&show=false")
  end
end
```

When published, it will be available in Obsidian's Community Plugin Browser via: `Settings` â†’ `Community Plugins` â†’ `Browse` â†’ Search for *"Sidebar Toggler"*
